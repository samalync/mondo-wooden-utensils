# Product images from Instagram

Add your product photos here so the website uses your real images from [@mondowoodenutensils](https://www.instagram.com/mondowoodenutensils/).

## How to add images

1. Open [Instagram: mondowoodenutensils](https://www.instagram.com/mondowoodenutensils/).
2. Download or save the photos you want for each product (e.g. from posts or reels).
3. Save them in this folder.

Currently the site is wired to use these filenames:

- `product-01.png` … `product-15.png`

If you rename or add images, update the `image` fields in `src/lib/products.ts` to match.

4. Restart or refresh the site. The product pages and cart will show these images.
